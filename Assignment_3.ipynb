    "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "Ans. Functions are advantegous because it provides reusability & efficient code writing.\n",
    "Certain set of pre-written commands we can use anywhere by just calling the function with req. arguements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When does the code in a function run: when its specified or when its called?\n",
    "Ans. Function is made by keyword \"def\" after which name of function comes & colon. After proper indentation in next line\n",
    ",the code block is written in function which runs when we call function with its name & () open/close parenthesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. What statement creates a function?\n",
    "Ans. def statement created function.\n",
    "For ex-\n",
    "def add_calculator(a,b):\n",
    "    return a+b\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "Ans. Function is a certain set of pre-written commands/codes for performing some specific kind of operations whereas function\n",
    "call is just to call/use that function to take the result with desired input/arguement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "Ans. \n",
    "Global scope is only one which means if we define a variable without any indentation not inside any loops, functions etc.\n",
    "It means it is globally present & can be accessed throughtout that program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Local scope is when we define something inside of function & it can be accessed only as the function is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "Ans. \n",
    "They gets used when function is called & after return they gets destroyed and cannot be accessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "Return is the final result or outcome of the function call. It can be used in inside any expression as it return a value which \n",
    "has a meaning instead of nonetype results in printing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    "Ans. It won't return anything if it doesn't have return statement in end of function code block.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "Ans. We can write \"global\" keywork with variable name inside the function to form a connection between local & global \n",
    "variable which will automatically get updated as per the local variable which is function variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is the data type of None?\n",
    "Ans. Data type of none is nonetype.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What does the sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic do?\n",
    "Ans. import is used to import inbuilt modules from python to current workbook or code. But \"areallyourpetsnamederic\"\n",
    "generates an error name \"ModuleNotFoundError\" as no such module exists in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "12. If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam?\n",
    "Ans. \n",
    "import spam\n",
    "spam.bacon()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "We can use to catch those erros in try & except blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "The try block is used to check the code for errors i.e the code inside the try block will execute when \n",
    "there is no error in the program. Whereas the code inside the except block will execute whenever the program \n",
    "encounters some error in the try block."
